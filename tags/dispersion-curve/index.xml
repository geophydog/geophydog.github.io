      <description>1. Background Ambient noise tomography has been a very popular imaging strategy of investigating the earth&amp;rsquo;s interior in past over two decades. The basic principle of this method is that stacked cross-correlations from noise recordings made by two receivers can be approximately the Green&amp;rsquo;s function from one receiver to another. We have the need of synthesizing ambient noise for validating this important idea, or exploring characteristics of ambient noise. Here we introduce a simple way of computing synthetic ambient noise.</description>

      <description>Background Ambient noise tomography is widely used to image th earth&amp;rsquo;s interior in past over two decades for various scales. Stacked cross-correlations from seismic ambient noise can be approxmately the Green&amp;rsquo;s functions between receivers. Surface waves extracted from ambient noise cross-correlations are frequently utilized to estimate multi-layered shear wave velocity structure. The key to surface wave imageing is reliable dispersion curves. Two-staion techniques, like frequency-time analysis (Levshin et al., 1989), image transform (Yao et al.</description>
