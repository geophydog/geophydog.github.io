      <description>1. Background Passive dense array surface wave tomography plays a significant role in probing the earth&amp;rsquo;s interior with the development of a large number of dense seismic arrays, attracting researchers&amp;rsquo; growing interest in imaging applications in various scales. These array methods, like beamforming and MASW (multichannel analysis of surface wave) have been widely used to estimate dispersion curves in past several decades. A new array stacking technique, the frequency-Bessel (F-J) transform, was proposed about five years ago with some main advantages of extracting dispersion curves of high-resolution and broad frequency band (Wang et al.</description>

      <description>1. Background Ambient noise tomography has been a very popular imaging strategy of investigating the earth&amp;rsquo;s interior in past over two decades. The basic principle of this method is that stacked cross-correlations from noise recordings made by two receivers can be approximately the Green&amp;rsquo;s function from one receiver to another. We have the need of synthesizing ambient noise for validating this important idea, or exploring characteristics of ambient noise. Here we introduce a simple way of computing synthetic ambient noise.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations From Seismic Ambient Noise</title>

      <description>New responses between station pairs can be extracted from diffuse wave field by cross-correlating ambient seismic noise or coda (Campillo &amp;amp; Paul, 2003; Bensen et al., 2007). However, some processing techniques should be taken into consideration to retrieve clear emperical green&amp;rsquo;s functions (EGFs). Here we show these steps in detail.
$\boxed{\text{Data processing steps}}$
1. Cut data 2. Removing mean, trend and tapering 3. Removing instrument response 4. Band-pass filtering 5. Temperal normalization $\boxed{\text{One-bit}}$ $$ \tilde{d_j}=sign(d_j) \tag{1} $$ $\boxed{\text{run absolute mean}}$ $$ \begin{aligned} w_j &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2N+1}\sum_{n=j-N}^{j+N}|d_n| \\</description>

      <description>1 Basic principles Detection of coherent seismic signals is an interesting topic in seismology. However, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to identify these coherent signals with single station because of the low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Based on the array processing techniques in radial astronomy, radar and acoustics, the seismic array methods have been developed well in the past several decades. Here, we just follow the articles contributed by (Capon, 1970; Euler et al.</description>
