      <description>1. Background Passive dense array surface wave tomography plays a significant role in probing the earth&amp;rsquo;s interior with the development of a large number of dense seismic arrays, attracting researchers&amp;rsquo; growing interest in imaging applications in various scales. These array methods, like beamforming and MASW (multichannel analysis of surface wave) have been widely used to estimate dispersion curves in past several decades. A new array stacking technique, the frequency-Bessel (F-J) transform, was proposed about five years ago with some main advantages of extracting dispersion curves of high-resolution and broad frequency band (Wang et al.</description>

      <description>1 Background Ambient seismic noise cross-correlation has far-reaching implications for the passive seismic surface wave imaging from regional to continental scales (e.g. Campillo &amp;amp; Paul, Shapiro &amp;amp; Campillo, 2004). Spectral analysis of cross-correlations is the key to retrieving reliable dispersion information about surface waves. Based on the Fourier spectra of event seismic surface wave data, however, we need to shift the cross-correlation time function before doing FFT to obtain the right spectra.</description>
