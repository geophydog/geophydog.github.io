      <description>1. Background Passive dense array surface wave tomography plays a significant role in probing the earth&amp;rsquo;s interior with the development of a large number of dense seismic arrays, attracting researchers&amp;rsquo; growing interest in imaging applications in various scales. These array methods, like beamforming and MASW (multichannel analysis of surface wave) have been widely used to estimate dispersion curves in past several decades. A new array stacking technique, the frequency-Bessel (F-J) transform, was proposed about five years ago with some main advantages of extracting dispersion curves of high-resolution and broad frequency band (Wang et al.</description>

      <description>Background Ambient noise tomography is widely used to image th earth&amp;rsquo;s interior in past over two decades for various scales. Stacked cross-correlations from seismic ambient noise can be approxmately the Green&amp;rsquo;s functions between receivers. Surface waves extracted from ambient noise cross-correlations are frequently utilized to estimate multi-layered shear wave velocity structure. The key to surface wave imageing is reliable dispersion curves. Two-staion techniques, like frequency-time analysis (Levshin et al., 1989), image transform (Yao et al.</description>
